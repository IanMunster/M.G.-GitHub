#Media And Game Development Projects:

All colaboration projects are in the main "M.G.-Github" folder.
The "Personal" folder is simply a back-up of all my personal-made or unfinished projects during the Media and Game studie.

All projects are still downloadable, but I suggest moving them to your own personal Github, if you need the project in the future.
